            I am thrilled to share that I successfully completed the <strong>Mini Bootcamp: Backend Python Batch 1</strong> at <strong>Alhazen Academy</strong> from <strong>February 17 to February 19, 2025</strong>. This intensive 3-day program was an incredible journey into the world of backend development using Python, equipping me with foundational skills and hands-on experience in key tools and techniques used in the industry.
          </p>

          <p>
            The bootcamp was designed to achieve the following objectives:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc ml-5 space-y-2 text-left md:text-justify">
            <li><strong>Introduce Fundamental Concepts</strong>: Understand the basics of Python programming and backend development.</li>
            <li><strong>Hands-On Python Programming</strong>: Gain practical experience in Python for backend development.</li>
            <li><strong>Basic Syntax and Statements</strong>: Learn the basic syntax, statements, and functions in Python.</li>
            <li><strong>Variables and Input Handling</strong>: Master the use of variables and input functions in Python.</li>
            <li><strong>Practical Exercises and Projects</strong>: Apply skills through hands-on exercises and real-world case studies.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            During the bootcamp, I gained proficiency in the following tools and technologies:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc ml-5 space-y-2 text-left md:text-justify">
            <li><strong>Python</strong>: Essentials for backend development, including basic syntax, variables, and functions.</li>
            <li><strong>Interactive and Scripting Mode</strong>: Using Python in both interactive and scripting modes.</li>
            <li><strong>Basic Python Functions</strong>: Utilizing functions like <code>print()</code> and <code>input()</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Error Handling</strong>: Understanding and handling syntax errors in Python.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            One of the key tasks during the bootcamp was to create a Python program that produces a specific output, as shown in the task image. I successfully completed this task, which involved creating a program that interacts with the user and displays the correct output based on their input.
          </p>

          <p>
            This bootcamp has significantly enhanced my ability to work with Python for backend development. The hands-on projects and real-world scenarios provided during the course have given me the confidence to tackle backend challenges head-on and develop efficient solutions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Completing this bootcamp has been a pivotal step in my journey as a backend developer. It has not only strengthened my technical skills but also deepened my appreciation for the power of Python in backend development. I am excited to apply these skills in my future projects and continue growing in the field of backend development.
