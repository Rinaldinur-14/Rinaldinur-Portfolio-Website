## üìä **Challenges and Problems**
While building this website, I faced several challenges:
- **New to Programming**: As a self-taught programmer, I struggled with positioning and design at times, requiring extensive research and experimentation.
- **Time-Consuming Process**: The project took longer than expected due to my focus on detail and desire to implement advanced features.
- **Code Organization**: The codebase is not as tidy as I would like, making future updates and maintenance more challenging.
- **Unrealized Features**: Some features I envisioned, such as a 3D website, were beyond my current skill level and had to be postponed for future projects.

## üìù **Recommendations for Improvement**
To enhance the website further, I plan to:
- **Improve Code Structure**: Refactor the code to make it more modular and maintainable.
- **Add 3D Elements**: Explore Three.js or similar libraries to create a 3D version of the website.
- **Enhance UI/UX**: Incorporate more animations and interactive elements to make the website even more engaging.
- **Optimize Performance**: Reduce load times and improve responsiveness for an even smoother user experience.
